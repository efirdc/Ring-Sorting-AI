#### Usage

The command `source setup_env.sh` will create a python virtual environment, install prerequisites, and then activate
the virtual environment. The created environment is located at `../air_berlin_group1_env/`

For future runs just use `source activate_env.sh` to activate the existing environment.

The program can then be initiated with `./run_air_berlin.py`
